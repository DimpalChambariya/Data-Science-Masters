APIs define the methods, data formats, and authentication mechanisms that enable seamless integration and interaction between various software systems.\n",

    "An example of API usage in real life is in social media platforms. For instance, the Twitter API allows developers to access and interact with Twitter's platform programmatically. This API enables developers to retrieve tweets, post tweets, perform searches, access user profiles, and perform various other actions on the Twitter platform. By using the Twitter API, developers can integrate Twitter functionality into their own applications or create tools that interact with Twitter's services. This integration allows users to view and post tweets, access their timelines, and interact with Twitter's features through third-party applications or services."
